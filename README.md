# IBM Transactions for Anti-Money Laundering (AML)
This project focuses on the application of machine learning algorithms for classification in the field of antimoney laundering (AML) using the IBM Transactions dataset. The primary objective is to develop a predictive model that can accurately classify transactions as either suspicious or legitimate based on various features. Six different machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Gradient Boost Tree, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Factorization Machine, and Support Vector Machine, are evaluated for their performance. The evaluation of the models includes measuring precision, recall, and feature importance. The results indicate that the timing of the transaction, originating bank, and destination bank account exhibit the highest feature importance, suggesting that these factors play a crucial role in distinguishing suspicious transactions from legitimate ones. The findings of this project demonstrate the efficacy of machine learning algorithms in the context of AML and emphasize the significance of specific features in identifying suspicious transactions.
